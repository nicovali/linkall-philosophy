## Books

-   Syntactic Structures - a major work by Chomsky that outlines his theory of universal grammar, which suggests that the ability to acquire and use language is innate to the human mind.
-   Language and Mind - a book by Chomsky that discusses the relationship between language and thought, and the ways in which language shapes and is shaped by the mind.

## Concepts

-   Universal grammar - the idea that the human mind is equipped with an innate set of mental structures that enable the acquisition and use of language, and that these structures are common to all human languages.
-   Language acquisition - the process by which children learn to use and understand language. Chomsky's theories have had a significant impact on the understanding of this process.
-   Mind-body dualism - the idea that the mind and body are separate and distinct entities, and that the mind is not reducible to the physical processes of the brain. Chomsky has argued that the mind-body dualism is implicit in the way we think about language and cognition.
